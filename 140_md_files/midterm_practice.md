### A. Adhikari ###

The midterm will be during the lecture hour (5:10 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.) on Thursday February 28. This is a summary of the material for the exam, grouped by main topic. The general techniques are in the sections Probability, Distribution, and Expectation. The next two sections consist of applications. 

Labs are listed by topic. Please also review your homework, quizzes, and the problems in the Review Sets at the ends of Chapters 5, 8, and 11. 

Homework 5, due Tuesday February 26, consists of the Fall 2018 midterm. 
The Spring 2018 midterm will be posted for additional practice.
