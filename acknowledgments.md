I developed Stat 88 in Fall 2015 as a seminar course for about 25 students. The goal was for the participants to discover the mathematics together and then write it up correctly and in a manner that would be accessible to their peers. Though the course has now changed substantially and serves hundreds of students each semester, its foundations were established by the class of Fall 2015:

Shreya Agarwal, Thomas Anthony, Bryannie Bach, Adith Balamurugan, Betty Chang, Aditya Gandhi, Dibya Ghosh, Edward Huang, Jiayi Huang, Weston Hughes, Arvind Iyengar, Andrew Linxie, Rahil Mathur, Nishaad Navkal, Kyle Nguyen, Christopher Sauceda, Rohan Singh, Parth Singhal, Max Weinstein, Yu Xia, Anthony Xian, and Ling Xie.

Dibya Ghosh continued to work with me on the textbook and was the editor of subsequent drafts.

Chris Holdgraf developed the system for publishing the book online.

The exposition owes much to two Berkeley texts: *Probability* by Jim Pitman, and the masterpiece *Statistics* by Freedman, Pisani, and Purves.
